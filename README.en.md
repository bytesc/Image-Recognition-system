## How to use

python version 3.9

Requires `4GB` or more memory

First install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

zlzheimer-diagnostic-system.py is the project entry point, run this file to start the server

```bash
python zlzheimer-diagnostic-system.py
```

Copy the link to the browser and open it

Click "Demo" to enter the Web interface

![image](./readme_img/5.png)

After that, you can click "Use example images" to use the default test cases. You can also upload .nii image files for testing.
I provide a small number of sample image data in the [`lqdata` repository](https://github.com/bytesc/lqdata).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bytesc/lqdata.git
```

- If an error is reported after uploading the image, you may need to manually create a folder `uploaded_img` in the root directory.

        The purpose of this operation is to extract features from the input x and nonlinearize them so that the network can better learn these features. The batch normalization technique used here can accelerate the training process of the model and improve its generalization ability. The final output result is a feature map x processed by convolutional, batch normalization and ReLU activation functions.

        The pooling operation extracts the maximum value in each pooling window in the feature map as the value at the corresponding position in the output feature map, thereby reducing the size of the feature map by half.

        Maximum pooling can help the network achieve spatial invariance so that it can recognize the same features when there are slight changes in the input. In this model, after maximum pooling, the feature map x will be passed to the next convolutional layer for feature extraction and nonlinear processing.

        The dropout operation sets some elements of the input tensor to zero with a certain probability, achieving the purpose of random deactivation. This can reduce overfitting and enhance the generalization ability of the model.

        In this model, the dropout operation is applied before the fully connected layer, which can help the model better learn the features of the data and prevent overfitting.
